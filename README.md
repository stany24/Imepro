## Description
The objectif is to give teachers a way to monitor and help there students.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

If you have a problem with the package System.Text.Json you need to uninstall it then reinstall it.
